## About

This is the first custom firmware for the Diamond Display. It's based on NRF version 221122, which is the "torque update". It's patched to default startup in mode 4 (off road mode), instead of mode 2 (US Only, for now). Additionally, this firmware has been patched with a new public key (SuperDuper Skeleton Key) to allow for future patch updates to be applied via Bluetooth.

Finally, the word "versions" on the display's settings menu that shows the version numbers has been patched to show "versionz" in order to visually verify the patches have been applied.

## Compatibility

This firmware should work on any display that is already running NRF version 221122. However, it may work on more. If you try it out, let us know how it goes in the Discord server!

## Warning

Applying this firmware will likely void any warranty. Also, this firmware will not accept future official updates from Super73.
